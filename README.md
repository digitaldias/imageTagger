# Getting started

In order to run this code you need to first: 
- Create a Cognitive Vision Service in Microsoft Azure (link comes later)
  - Navigate to [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://microsoft.com/cognitive)
  - Click on `Vision`
  - Click on `Computer Vision`
  - Click on the `Start Free` link to set up your Computer Vision instance
  - Once in the Azure Portal, remember to select the free option :)
- In the Azure Portal, locate the `Keys and Endpoint` page and be ready to copy the values
- Create a new text file in the folder "`My Documents`", name it `ImageTagger.Settings.Json` 
  - If you are on mac/linux, place it in your home folder `cd ~/`
- Paste in the API key and endpoint from the Azure Cognitive Vision API to the file like this:
 ```json
{
    "endpoint" : "<your endpoint here>",
    "apiKey" : "<your api key here"
}
 ```
- Compile and run the project :)
