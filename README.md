# Getting started

In order to run this code you need to first: 
- Create a Cognitive Vision Service in Microsoft Azure (link comes later)
- Create a new text file in the folder "`My Documents`", name it `ImageTagger.Settings.Json` 
-  Paste in the API key and endpoint from the Azure Cognitive Vision API to the file like this:
 ```json
{
    "endpoint" : "<your endpoint here>",
    "apiKey" : "<your api key here"
}
 ```
- Compile and run the project :)

Comments and feedback are appreciated.
